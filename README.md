# Deep Learning in R

This is the repository for D-Lab’s six-hour Introduction to Deep Learning in R workshop. [View the associated slides here](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/Deep-Learning-in-R/slides.html#1).

## Objectives

Convey the basics of deep learning in R using keras on image datasets. Students are empowered with a general grasp of deep learning, example code that they can modify, a working computational environment, and resources for further study.

## Content outline

* Installation
  * R and RStudio
  * Keras and Tensorflow
  * Helper packages
* What is “deep” learning? 
* Understanding the dataset
* Dataset splitting: training, test, cross-validation
  * Defining moving parts of a deep learning model 
  * Understanding a loss function, activation function, and metrics
  * Performance evaluation
* Part 1-2
  * MNIST 0-9 hand-written digit example 
  * Dogs or humans?
* Part 3-4
  * Pre-trained models + fine-tuning
  * X-ray classification: abdominal vs. chest classification
  * Google Cloud Machine Learning

## Prerequisites

This is an advanced level workshop. Participants should be intermediate R users and have had some prior exposure to machine learning.

We assume the following background:

* D-Lab's [Machine Learning in R introduction](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Machine-Learning-in-R) (6 hours) or its [tidymodels adaptation](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Machine-Learning-with-tidymodels)
* Or, comparable experience/training, assuming familiarity with:
  * Basic R syntax
  * statistical concepts such as mean and standard deviation
  * Train/test splitting and cross-validation
  * Dataset cleaning
  * Overfitting / underfitting
  * Hyperparameter customization

If you are not comfortable installing packages, writing your own R code, and using RStudio, this will not be a good workshop for you.

## Technology requirements

Please bring a laptop with the following:

* [R version](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
3.4 or greater
* [RStudio editor](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) is
highly recommended but not required.

## Getting Started

Be sure to [follow the install instructions](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Deep-Learning-in-R/blob/master/participant-instructions.md) to get started. This process can take about 30 minutes, so be sure to try and do this before class.
